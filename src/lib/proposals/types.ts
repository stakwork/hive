/**
 * Shared types for agent-proposed initiatives and features.
 *
 * The chat is the source of truth for proposal lifecycle:
 *   - The `propose_initiative` / `propose_feature` agent tools return
 *     a `ProposalOutput` from `execute(...)`. The streaming reducer
 *     already lifts tool outputs into `CanvasChatMessage.toolCalls[].
 *     output`, so a proposal lives in the conversation transcript for
 *     free.
 *   - The user clicks Approve / Reject in `<ProposalCard>`. Each click
 *     appends a normal user message carrying an `ApprovalIntent` /
 *     `RejectionIntent` field. The user-side message is suppressed
 *     visually — the card transition IS the user feedback.
 *   - The `/api/ask/quick` route detects the intent on the latest user
 *     message, runs the side effect (validate, create Initiative /
 *     Feature, write canvas position overlay if legal, fan out
 *     CANVAS_UPDATED), and streams a synthetic assistant message with
 *     `ApprovalResult` populated.
 *   - Status is *derived* from the conversation: a card scans the full
 *     message list for a matching `approvalResult` (→ approved) or
 *     `rejection` (→ rejected) by `proposalId`.
 *
 * Therefore: no DB schema changes, no new tables, no rehydration logic
 * beyond "load the conversation as you already do." Forks inherit the
 * proposal trail naturally.
 *
 * Idempotency on Approve: re-clicking just appends another approval
 * message. The route's pre-LLM scan finds the existing `approvalResult`
 * and short-circuits, returning the same `createdEntityId` again.

 * (with a small retry on `P2002` for the `(initiativeId, sequence)`
 * unique index), so the agent doesn't race with concurrent human
 * `+ Milestone` clicks.
 *
 * `featureIds` is the load-bearing extra: a milestone proposal can
 * carry a list of features to attach on approval. Every id MUST
 * already belong to `initiativeId` — the propose tool re-validates
 * this, the approval handler re-validates again. Empty array is legal
 * (a milestone with no features yet; the user can attach later via
 * the canvas drag/edge gestures). The agent should bias the list
 * toward features whose `milestoneId IS NULL` ("unlinked" features
 * on the initiative canvas — those without a synthetic edge to any
 * milestone card). Re-attaching an already-linked feature works but
 * moves it from its current milestone; the card surfaces this as a
 * warning so the user approves knowingly.
