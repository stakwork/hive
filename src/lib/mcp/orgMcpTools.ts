/**
 * Org-scope MCP tools.
 *
 * Exposes a single tool — `org_agent` — that the swarm-side plan
 * agent (or any future agent given an org-MCP token) can call back
 * into Hive to ask org-wide questions. Internally this delegates to
 * `runCanvasAgent`, the same primitive that powers the org SidebarChat
 * and the legacy `scoutOrgContext` pre-dispatch brief.
 *
 * Why a single tool instead of a fine-grained MCP surface:
 *
 *   The org canvas agent already has a coherent multi-workspace tool
 *   set (canvases, initiatives, research, connections, plus per-
 *   workspace concept/feature/task reads). Porting that surface to MCP
 *   would (a) explode to ~70+ tools for a 10-workspace org, (b) lose
 *   cross-tool state like the web_search citation linkifier in
 *   `update_research`, and (c) split reasoning across two LLM calls
 *   (orchestrator MCP-side + sub-agent in Hive) that today happens in
 *   one. The callback model that's "right" is *iterative on-demand
 *   context*, not *fine-grained tool exposure* — the agent on the
 *   swarm only needs answers, not navigation.
 *
 *   So we wrap `runCanvasAgent` as one tool. Caller sends a prompt,
 *   we run the full org agent with all the user's accessible
 *   workspaces and the org tool families, and return its final text.
 *
 * Auth & permission semantics:
 *
 *   - The org-JWT branch in `handler.ts` resolves the token's claims
 *     into `OrgMcpAuthExtra` and re-validates org membership at use
 *     time via `resolveAuthorizedOrgId`.
 *   - `permissions: ["read"]` → forces `readonly: true` inside
 *     `runCanvasAgent`. The agent can read canvases/research/etc. but
 *     cannot mutate state or emit propose_* cards.
 *   - `permissions: ["read", "write"]` → `readonly: false`. Full
 *     tool surface. Mint endpoint gates this by workspace role.
 *
 *   The tool also accepts a `readonly` arg from the caller, which can
 *   only *narrow* — a write-capable token can opt into a read-only
 *   run, but a read-only token can never produce writes regardless of
 *   what the caller asks for.
