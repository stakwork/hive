# Neon Database Configuration for Vercel

## Problem
The production database was experiencing connection pool exhaustion with errors:
- "Failed to acquire permit to connect to the database. Too many database connection attempts"
- "Can't reach database server" at Neon pooler endpoint

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Neon Serverless Adapter
Installed packages:
- `@neondatabase/serverless` - Neon's serverless-optimized PostgreSQL driver
- `@prisma/adapter-neon` - Prisma adapter for Neon serverless

### 2. Updated Prisma Configuration
- Modified `src/lib/db.ts` to use Neon serverless adapter in production
- Added `driverAdapters` preview feature to `prisma/schema.prisma`
- The adapter automatically manages connection pooling for serverless environments

### 3. Vercel Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT**: In your Vercel dashboard, ensure your `DATABASE_URL` uses the **pooled connection string** from Neon:

1. Go to your Neon dashboard
2. Navigate to your database connection settings
3. Use the **Pooled connection** string (not the Direct connection)
4. The URL should look like: `postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx-pooler.region.aws.neon.tech:5432/dbname?sslmode=require`
   - Note the `-pooler` suffix in the hostname

### 4. Connection String Format

Make sure your DATABASE_URL includes:
- `?sslmode=require` parameter
- The pooler endpoint (contains `-pooler` in hostname)
- Correct port (usually 5432 for pooled connections)

Example:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-delicate-sun-adjrp0t3-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech:5432/database_name?sslmode=require"
```

### 5. Neon Dashboard Settings

In your Neon project dashboard:
1. Check your compute endpoint settings
2. Ensure "Suspend compute after" is set appropriately (e.g., 5 minutes)
3. Monitor your connection pool usage in the Monitoring tab
4. Consider upgrading your plan if you consistently hit connection limits

### 6. Testing the Fix

After deploying:
1. Monitor Vercel function logs for database errors
2. Check Neon dashboard for connection pool metrics
3. The serverless adapter should automatically manage connections efficiently

## Benefits

The Neon serverless adapter provides:
- Automatic connection pooling optimized for serverless
- HTTP-based connections that work better with edge functions
- Reduced cold start times
- Better handling of connection limits in serverless environments
