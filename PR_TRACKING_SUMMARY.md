# PR Tracking Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an automated PR tracking system that monitors Pull Requests created by agent mode tasks and automatically marks tasks as complete when their PRs are merged.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

Added three new fields to the `Task` model:
- `prUrl` - Stores the GitHub PR URL
- `prBranch` - Stores the branch name
- `prMergedAt` - Timestamp when PR was merged (null until merged)

### 2. Commit Endpoint Update (`src/app/api/agent/commit/route.ts`)

Modified the POST handler to:
- Store PR URL and branch name after successful commit and push
- Use the first PR URL from the repository list
- Log success/failure of storing PR tracking info
- Continue gracefully if storage fails (non-blocking)

### 3. PR Tracking Service (`src/services/pr-tracking-cron.ts`)

Created a new service with:
- `executePRTracking()` - Main function that processes all eligible tasks
- `parseGitHubPRUrl()` - Extracts owner/repo from PR URLs
- `checkPRMergeStatus()` - Calls GitHub API to check if PR is merged

**Key Features:**
- Queries agent tasks with open PRs (not yet marked as merged)
- Validates task eligibility (has workspace, source control org, GitHub token)
- Checks GitHub API for PR merge status
- Updates task status to DONE when PR is merged
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Returns execution statistics

### 4. Cron Endpoint (`src/app/api/cron/pr-tracking/route.ts`)

Created GET endpoint that:
- Can be called by cron schedulers (e.g., Vercel Cron)
- Checks `PR_TRACKING_ENABLED` environment variable
- Executes the PR tracking service
- Returns JSON with execution results and statistics
- Handles errors gracefully with proper status codes

### 5. Comprehensive Tests (`src/__tests__/unit/services/pr-tracking-cron.test.ts`)

Created 16 test cases covering:
- ✅ Successful PR merge detection and task completion
- ✅ No action when PRs are not merged
- ✅ Handling of missing PRs
- ✅ Multiple tasks with different PR states
- ✅ GitHub API errors
- ✅ Missing GitHub tokens
- ✅ Invalid PR URLs
- ✅ Missing source control org
- ✅ Database errors
- ✅ Critical system errors
- ✅ Proper query filtering (agent mode, non-null fields, etc.)
- ✅ Inclusion of necessary database relations

### 6. Documentation (`docs/pr-tracking.md`)

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Feature overview and workflow
- Database schema details
- Configuration instructions
- API endpoint documentation
- Error handling scenarios
- Workflow example walkthrough
- Testing instructions
- Monitoring and troubleshooting guides
- Security considerations
- Future enhancement ideas

## How to Deploy

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Generate migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_pr_tracking_to_tasks

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

```bash
# Disable PR tracking if needed (default: enabled)
PR_TRACKING_ENABLED=false
```

### 3. Configure Cron Job

**For Vercel** (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/pr-tracking",
      "schedule": "*/10 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**For other platforms**, set up a scheduled job to call:
```
GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/pr-tracking
```

Recommended schedule: Every 5-15 minutes

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only PR tracking tests
npm test pr-tracking-cron

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### 5. Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to your platform
vercel deploy --prod
# or
npm run deploy
```

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Test Flow

1. **Create an agent task**
   ```
   - Navigate to workspace
   - Create new task in agent mode
   - Start the task
   ```

2. **Make code changes and commit**
   ```
   - Agent makes changes
   - Click "Commit" button
   - System stores PR URL and branch
   ```

3. **Create PR on GitHub**
   ```
   - Click the PR URL from the UI
   - Create pull request on GitHub
   - Add description and reviewers
   ```

4. **Merge the PR**
   ```
   - Get PR approved
   - Merge the PR on GitHub
   ```

5. **Wait for cron**
   ```
   - Wait for next cron execution (e.g., 10 minutes)
   - Check task status - should be DONE
   - Check prMergedAt field - should have timestamp
   ```

### Verify Database

```sql
-- Check task after commit
SELECT id, title, mode, pr_url, pr_branch, pr_merged_at, status
FROM tasks
WHERE id = 'your-task-id';

-- Check after PR merge
SELECT id, title, pr_merged_at, status, workflow_status
FROM tasks
WHERE id = 'your-task-id';
-- Should show: status='DONE', pr_merged_at=<timestamp>, workflow_status='COMPLETED'
```

### Monitor Cron Execution

```bash
# Call cron endpoint manually
curl https://your-domain.com/api/cron/pr-tracking

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "tasksProcessed": 1,
  "tasksCompleted": 1,
  "errorCount": 0,
  "errors": [],
  "timestamp": "2024-10-28T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Cron Instead of Webhooks?

**Pros of Cron:**
- Simpler implementation
- No webhook setup required
- Works across all GitHub repositories
- Easier to monitor and debug
- Controllable execution frequency

**Cons:**
- Slight delay (based on cron frequency)
- More API calls to GitHub

**Future Enhancement:** Add webhook support for real-time updates

### Why Store PR Data in Task Model?

- **Single source of truth** - All task data in one place
- **Simple queries** - Easy to find tasks with open PRs
- **Audit trail** - Track when PRs were created and merged
- **No additional tables** - Keeps schema simple

### Why Check PR Status via API?

- **Reliable** - Always reflects current GitHub state
- **No webhook configuration** - Works without GitHub webhook setup
- **Handles edge cases** - Works even if webhook is missed
- **Simple to test** - Easy to mock API responses

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- Query uses indexed fields (`mode`, `status`, `deleted`)
- Filters for only agent tasks with PR data
- Orders by `createdAt` for consistent processing
- Includes relations efficiently with Prisma

### GitHub API Calls

- One API call per task with open PR
- Rate limit: 5000 requests/hour for authenticated requests
- Example: 100 open PRs × 6 cron runs/hour = 600 requests/hour (well under limit)

### Optimization Tips

1. **Adjust cron frequency** based on task volume
2. **Add pagination** if processing 100+ tasks
3. **Implement rate limiting** if approaching GitHub limits
4. **Cache PR states** to reduce redundant API calls

## Security

### Token Management

- Uses workspace-level GitHub App tokens
- Tokens fetched server-side only
- No token exposure to frontend
- Token scope limited to repository access

### Data Validation

- PR URLs validated before parsing
- Graceful handling of malformed data
- No direct user input to GitHub API
- SQL injection prevented by Prisma ORM

### Error Handling

- Errors logged but don't expose sensitive data
- Failed tasks don't block other tasks
- System continues on individual task failures
- All errors tracked for monitoring

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Success Rate** - `success` field in cron response
2. **Tasks Processed** - Number of tasks checked per run
3. **Tasks Completed** - Number of tasks marked as DONE
4. **Error Count** - Number of failures per run
5. **Execution Time** - Duration of cron execution

### Set Up Alerts

- Alert on `success: false` responses
- Alert on high error counts (>10% of tasks)
- Alert on zero completions for extended period
- Alert on cron execution failures

### Log Analysis

Search for these patterns:
```
[PRTracking] - Main execution logs
✓ Task ... marked as DONE - Successful completions
Error processing task - Individual task failures
Critical execution error - System-level issues
```

## Known Limitations

1. **PR Detection Timing**
   - Tasks completed only after cron runs
   - Delay based on cron frequency (e.g., 10 minutes)
   
2. **Single Repository**
   - Currently tracks only first repository's PR
   - Multi-repo tasks need manual completion
   
3. **Branch Matching**
   - Assumes branch name matches exactly
   - Force-pushed branches may cause issues
   
4. **Deleted PRs**
   - Closed/deleted PRs without merge won't complete task
   - Requires manual status update

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Add PR number to task record
- [ ] Support multiple repositories per task
- [ ] Add PR status field (open, closed, merged)
- [ ] Notify users when task is auto-completed

### Medium Term
- [ ] Implement GitHub webhooks for real-time updates
- [ ] Add PR comment with task link
- [ ] Track PR metrics (time to merge, reviewers, etc.)
- [ ] Support other Git platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket)

### Long Term
- [ ] Auto-create PRs from agent commits
- [ ] Integrate PR reviews into task workflow
- [ ] AI-powered PR description generation
- [ ] Automated PR conflict resolution

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Task not completing after PR merge

**Check:**
1. Is cron job running? → Test `/api/cron/pr-tracking`
2. Is task in agent mode? → Check `mode` field
3. Are PR fields populated? → Check `prUrl`, `prBranch`
4. Is GitHub token valid? → Test token in GitHub API
5. Is PR actually merged? → Check GitHub PR status

**Fix:**
- Manually trigger cron endpoint
- Update PR fields if incorrect
- Re-authenticate GitHub App
- Check cron logs for errors

### High error rate

**Common Causes:**
- Invalid GitHub tokens → Re-authenticate
- Rate limit reached → Reduce cron frequency
- Database connection issues → Check DB health
- Malformed PR URLs → Audit data quality

**Fix:**
- Review error logs for patterns
- Update affected tasks manually
- Improve data validation
- Add retry logic for transient errors

### Cron not running

**Check:**
- Cron configuration in platform
- Environment variables
- API endpoint accessibility
- Authentication/authorization

**Fix:**
- Verify cron schedule syntax
- Test endpoint manually
- Check platform logs
- Ensure endpoint is public

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check logs for `[PRTracking]` entries
2. Review error messages in cron response
3. Consult `/docs/pr-tracking.md`
4. Run tests to verify functionality
5. Check database for data integrity

## Success Criteria
